==========

An experiment using the Gorillas game

## TODO

### Now

* How many players can we support? (default 2)
* Player greeting (1p, 2p, 4p) (disable 1p and 4p for now)
** Add a vanilla player to the manager for each 
* Player name and character selection

* Once the players are done, make a game for them
* Choose a city (default Seattle for now)
* Choose day or night

* Jump into a round (draw initial set of buildings)
** Render city BG
** Render city FG
* Allow a refresh of the skyline until all players agree

### Soon


### Later

* Draw Gorillas
* Animate Throw
* Explosions
* Hit detection
* clouds
* animate arms for throws
* cars
