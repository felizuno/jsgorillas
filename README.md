jsGorillas
==========

An experiment in message passing using the Gorillas game.

The goal is to dogfood a new [message passing library](https://github.com/felizuno/jsgorillas/blob/master/js/messenger.js) I'm working on.
For this reason this project's modules communicate using the `sendRequestFor(...).soICan(...)` pattern, which is verbose and in progress.

## TODO

### Now

* Stop using the building to position the gorilla. Reformat the round for that. The game should plan on using the layers available
* Update gorilla drawing to be animatable

### Soon

** Choose day or night
** Choose a city (default Seattle for now)
* Player character selection

### Later

* Draw Gorillas
* Animate Throw
* Explosions
* Hit detection
* clouds
* animate arms for throws
* cars
